# What is this?
This is a Supercollider synthesizer/audio effect that uses a delay line to establish a FIR filter with harmonic resonant frequencies perceivable as pitch and timbre. 

# How does it work?
A multitap delay line filter.

# Changes
Moir√© synth is now a UGen (see [UGen repo](https://github.com/kj-jondell/UGens)). This repo contains helper files and implementations of this UGen.

# TODO
1. Use SpecFlatness as metric of Moire harmonicity
